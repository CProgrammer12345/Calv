                        Pretty much, my life is bad. I waste my time playing video games on the daily and I watch too many youtube videos. Sometimes, I get up on my lazy butt
                        and do stuff like this, which really isn't much better than this. I guess coding is kinda fun;that's the reason why I'm wasting my time doing this crap. Well, 
                        no one is gonna find this anyway so this is just a project. To the <small>0.0001%</small> who find this, Hola!

                        So, I was born in  Canada in the middle of nowhere. Me and my sister would always get nosebleeds and we were also both dumb.
                        We moved to Flordia later in our lives and I decided to get good at math. I then became lazy again and now I'm not smart, but I'm not retarded either.
